A Dash app for viewing and managing the Trends.Earth GEF API, supporting admin features and authentication.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This application supports automatic deployment to EC2 instances using Docker Swarm and GitHub Actions.

### Available Deployment Workflows:
- **Production Deployment** (`deploy-production.yml`) - Production deployment to EC2 with Docker Swarm, health checks, and Rollbar integration
- **Staging Deployment** (`deploy-staging.yml`) - Staging deployment to EC2 for testing and validation  
- **Production Rollback** (`rollback-production.yml`) - Manual rollback to previous deployments or specific commits

### Deployment Architecture:
- **Platform**: EC2 instances with Docker Swarm
- **SSH Deployment**: Secure deployment via SSH using GitHub Actions
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks and integration testing
- **Security**: Dynamic security group management for GitHub Actions runners
- **Registry**: Local Docker registry with build-on-server approach

### Error Tracking
The application includes integrated Rollbar error tracking for production monitoring and debugging.

### Setup Instructions
For detailed deployment setup instructions, see:
- [Deployment README](docs/deployment/README.md) - Overview and GitHub secrets configuration
- [AWS Infrastructure Setup](docs/deployment/aws-infrastructure-setup.md) - EC2 and AWS resource setup
- [Setup Script](scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh) - Automated GitHub secrets configuration

- **Coverage**: Code coverage is tracked and reported to Codecov

### Code Quality Tools

The project uses Ruff for both linting and code formatting:

```bash
# Lint code with Ruff
poetry run ruff check trendsearth_ui/ tests/

# Format code with Ruff
poetry run ruff format trendsearth_ui/ tests/

# Fix auto-fixable issues
poetry run ruff check --fix trendsearth_ui/ tests/
```

## Configuration

### Application Configuration
The API endpoints are configured in `trendsearth_ui/config.py` with support for multiple environments:

```python
API_ENVIRONMENTS = {
    "production": {
        "base": "https://api.trends.earth/api/v1",
        "auth": "https://api.trends.earth/auth",
        "display_name": "Production (api.trends.earth)",
    },
    "staging": {
        "base": "https://api-staging.trends.earth/api/v1", 
        "auth": "https://api-staging.trends.earth/auth",
        "display_name": "Staging (api-staging.trends.earth)",
    },
}
```

Users can switch between environments via the UI, with production as the default.

### Gunicorn Configuration
Production deployment uses Gunicorn with the configuration in `gunicorn.conf.py`. 
Key settings:
- Single worker process (required for Dash callback routing)
- 120 second timeout
- Bound to 0.0.0.0:8000
- Request logging enabled
